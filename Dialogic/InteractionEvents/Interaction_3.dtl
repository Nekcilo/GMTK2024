Having escaped their own home to visit The Dragon, The Princet returns to the cave, hoping for a lack of angry mob.
As they approach, it’s clear to see that The Dragon's cave is in disarray, with broken stones and debris scattered around from the events of the day before.
The dragon slowly emerges slightly from the shadows, risking it all to reveal a bit more of its form to the Princet.
- Apologise
	Princet: ....I apologise for not intervening. I’m so sorry for what they’ve done. I didn’t expect residents of the kingdom to hold this much grievance.
	The Princet lowers their head in shame, attempting to show their sincerity.
	The dragon remains silent but edges a bit closer to the light, acknowledging the apology.

- Offer to help
	Princet: This is... terrible. Let me help you clean this up. It's the least I can do.
	The Princet keeps their distance from the dragon, respecting the hesitance to let someone into their home. They gather the scattered debris and stones, carefully placing them outside the cave.
	The dragon watches intently, a hint of gratitude in its eyes as it moves slightly closer to the cave entrance.

- Blame
	Princet: If you had just defended yourself, this wouldn’t have happened.
	The dragon’s eyes flash with anger, a deep growl rumbling from its chest.
	The Princet steps back, feeling the intensity of the dragon's gaze before retreating hastily.
